# Leaseplan Information Services
## Fullstack .NET Developer Technical Test

Create simple currency exchange calculator.
Main goals:
1. Create REST WebApi using ASP.NET Framework or ASP.NET Core (preferable)
2. Create simple Angular or React (preferable) application

Details:
1. The API should return a potentially infinite number of defined currencies and their exchange
rates. There is no need to create a database to store them - values can be either hardcoded in
WebAPI or defined in the JSON file.
1. Consume the API with Angular or React application
2. Allow user to enter the amount to exchange
3. Display the result.

Bonus points:
1. Unit tests
2. Responsive design
